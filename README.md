# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
A model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) which can correctly classify the handwritten digits from 0-9 based on the pixel values given as features.

INTRODUCTION:
The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human 
handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not 
perfect and can be made with many different flavours. Handwritten digit recognition is a 
complex problem due to the fact that variation exists in writing style of different writers. 
The phenomenon that makes the problem more challenging is the inherent variation in 
writing styles at different instances. Due to this reason, building a generic recognizer that is 
capable of recognizing handwritten digits written by diverse writers is not always feasible. 
However, the extraction of the most informative features with highly discriminatory 
ability to improve the classification accuracy with reduced complexity remains one of the 
most important problems for this task. It is a task of great importance for which there are 
standard databases that allow different approaches to be compared and validated. The 
handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit 
and recognizes the digit present in the image. The popular MNIST dataset is used to classify 
the digits between 0-9. SVM Algorithm is used to build model that gives the best accuracy.
